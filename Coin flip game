alice and bob flip a coin each in seperated rooms.
alice has to guess correctly bob's result and bob does the same fo alice, without any contact. 
if alice guesses wrong she dies... same goes for bob.
our objective is to come up with a method that insures the survival of at least one of them.
the code below shows 100% survival for at least one player

import random

def CoinFlip():
    posib = [(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)]
    index = random.randint(0,3)
    a,b = posib[index]
    alice_guess = 0
    bob_guess = 0
    if a == 0:
        alice_guess = 1
    else:
        alice_guess = 0
    bob_guess = b
    if bob_guess == a or alice_guess == b:
        return True
    else:
        return False

#correct answer is: A U (not b).

def main():
    c = 0
    for i in range(1000):
        boolean = CoinFlip()
        if boolean is True:
            c += 1
    print(c)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
